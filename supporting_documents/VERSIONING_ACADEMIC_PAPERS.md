# Versioning Academic Papers: A Guide to Semantic Versioning for Research

In an academic context, versioning can help readers and collaborators track significant changes in a paper. By applying Semantic Versioning, you can indicate the scale of each update, making it clear when minor adjustments or major revisions have been made. This guide covers scenarios in which each type of version change might apply in academic work.

## 1. When to Apply Major Version Changes

Major versions (`X.0.0`) reflect substantial updates that significantly alter the paper's content or direction. Consider a major version update in scenarios like these:

- **Preprints and Iterative Revisions**: When an initial preprint undergoes extensive feedback-based changes, such as major restructuring or new interpretations, a major version update (e.g., from `v1.0.0` to `v2.0.0`) distinguishes the revised paper.
- **Multi-Phase Studies or Longitudinal Research**: For studies conducted in phases or with additional data over time, each phase can correspond to a new major version if it changes the study’s focus or conclusions.
- **Major Theoretical or Methodological Shifts**: If there’s a fundamental change in theory, model, or methodology, moving to a new major version reflects this substantial shift in the research’s interpretation.
- **Replication Studies with New Findings**: A paper that replicates previous research but with substantial new findings or data may warrant a major version update to differentiate it from the original.

## 2. When to Apply Minor Version Changes

Minor versions (`0.Y.0`) are for moderate updates that add value without overhauling the core content or conclusions. Scenarios include:

- **Adding New References or Expanding Sections**: New literature, additional data, or expanded sections (e.g., an extended discussion) might increase the paper’s depth, meriting a minor version update (e.g., from `v1.1.0` to `v1.2.0`).
- **Substantial Peer Review Revisions**: If reviewer feedback leads to additional insights or moderate restructuring without changing the paper’s main findings, apply a minor version.
- **Updates in Systematic Reviews or Meta-Analyses**: When meta-analyses are updated with recent data but maintain the same methods and conclusions, a minor version change captures these additions.

## 3. When to Apply Patch Version Changes

Patch versions (`0.0.Z`) cover small fixes or improvements that don’t impact the main findings or arguments. Consider a patch update in cases such as:

- **Correcting Typos or Formatting Issues**: Minor corrections to wording, grammar, or layout would be reflected in patch versions (e.g., from `v1.1.0` to `v1.1.1`).
- **Minor Clarifications or Explanations**: Small clarifications that improve readability or understanding without changing the results.
- **Updating Citations or Footnotes**: Adding a missing reference or updating footnotes without altering the main content.

## 4. Using GitHub Tags and Releases

To manage and reference specific versions of the paper:

1. **Tags**: Create tags for each version (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v1.1.1`) to mark major, minor, and patch updates.
2. **Releases**: For significant versions, consider creating GitHub releases with a description of changes in that version.

Each release can include release notes that summarize the revisions, making it easy for readers to see what’s changed in each version.
