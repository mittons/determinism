## Introduction

This repository serves as a version-controlled publishing mechanism for writings on determinism and free will. The writings will loosely assert that all fully conscious decisions made by a human being throughout their lifespan are ultimately deterministic, determined directly or indirectly by external factors. The assertion will be accopmanied by some clarification on assumptions made.

Furthermore, this repository may, in future updates:
- List some key terms along with some factors that could be used to characterize those terms. These definitions will clarify whether the assertions made depend on a specific definition of a given factor or if the definition remains open.
- Include a "Further Discussion" section designed to provoke further thought and suggest some (but not all) of the potential questions that could be used to prime further consideration.
